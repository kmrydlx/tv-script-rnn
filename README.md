# TV Script Generation

In this project a [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV script is generated using RNNs. [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons, available from Kaggle, is used.  The Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
